The Kansas City Vault (Command Center)
Host City Motto: “The Soccer Capital of America & The Heart of the Tournament.”
1. Logistics & Transit (The "Arrowhead" Protocol)
* The Trap: Arrowhead Stadium (Kansas City Stadium) has 22,000 parking spots, but only 4,000 are available for the public. No ticket, no entry to the grounds.
* The Solution: Use ConnectKC26. The app will link to the 215+ motorcoaches running "Stadium Direct" routes from regional hubs (Lawrence, Overland Park, Independence, and Downtown).
* The Streetcar: Use the expanded KC Streetcar (free) to move between the Power & Light District and the Fan Festival at Liberty Memorial.
2. The Safety Net (Medical & Emergency)
* English-Speaking/International Expert: Children’s Mercy (downtown) has a dedicated International Travel Medicine Clinic—perfect for families traveling from abroad.
* Emergency Hub: Saint Luke’s Hospital (near the Plaza) is the primary high-capacity trauma center for the urban core.
* Gold Feature: One-tap 911 integration that automatically provides the user’s "Section and Row" if they are inside the stadium.
3. The Spiritual Compass
* The "Stadium Chapel": Unique to KC, the Faith and Family Chapel is located right at Arrowhead Stadium (south corner). It offers non-denominational services on match days.
* Regional Diversity:
* Islamic: The Islamic Center of Greater Kansas City (South KC) is a primary hub for Friday prayers.
* Jewish: The Jewish Community Center (The J) in Overland Park provides a safe, welcoming environment for visiting fans.
* Catholic: The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Downtown) is centrally located for those staying in the city core.
4. Watch Party Scouting
* The "Vibe" Festival: Liberty Memorial (National WWI Museum). This is the Official FIFA Fan Festival. Features the 65-foot "KC Heart Gateway" and 4,500 sq. ft. of video boards. Best for families and massive crowds.
* The "Energy" Hub: KC Live! (Power & Light District). High-intensity, adult-focused, and surrounded by bars. This is where the "viral" goal reaction videos will happen.
* The "Local" Secret: North Kansas City (Northtown). For a more curated, local business vibe with fewer crowds than the official Fan Fest.
5. The "Comfort" Guide (BBQ & Jazz)
* The BBQ Trail: The Concierge recommends Joe’s KC (Gas station vibe), Arthur Bryant’s (History), and Q39 (Premium dining) based on the user's distance from their hotel.
* The Jazz Beat: Direct maps to 18th & Vine and The Blue Room for late-night decompression after a match.

AI Concierge Proactive Message (Example for KC)
> "Welcome to the Heart of America! I see you've arrived in Kansas City. A quick heads-up: Parking at the stadium is extremely restricted today. I have secured your 'Stadium Direct' bus pass and mapped the shuttle pickup at Union Station. Since you have 3 hours before kickoff, would you like the walking route to the WWI Museum Fan Fest for a photo at the Heart Gateway?"
